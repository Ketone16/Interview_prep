#push a Docker image to JFrog Artifactory

===>In the corrected script, the use of ${ARTIFACTORY_URL} and ${REPOSITORY_NAME} represents the use of environment variables or parameters in a Jenkins pipeline. Let me break down the significance of these variables:

${ARTIFACTORY_URL}:

This variable holds the URL of your JFrog Artifactory instance. It's a good practice to define this as a variable because it allows you to configure it once and reuse it throughout your pipeline. If your Artifactory URL changes, you only need to update it in one place.

${REPOSITORY_NAME}:

This variable represents the name of the repository in your Artifactory where you want to push your Docker image. Similar to ${ARTIFACTORY_URL}, defining this as a variable allows for easy configuration and reuse. If you need to push images to different repositories, you can adjust this variable accordingly.
Using variables in this way makes your Jenkins pipeline more flexible and maintainable. 

pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        ARTIFACTORY_URL = 'https://your-artifactory-instance/artifactory'
        REPOSITORY_NAME = 'your-docker-repo'
    }

   stage('Push Docker Image to Artifactory') {
    steps {
        script {
            // Tag the Docker image
            sh "docker tag my-image:latest ${ARTIFACTORY_URL}/${REPOSITORY_NAME}/my-image:latest"

            // Log in to Artifactory
            sh "docker login ${ARTIFACTORY_URL}"

            // Push the Docker image to Artifactory
            sh "docker push ${ARTIFACTORY_URL}/${REPOSITORY_NAME}/my-image:latest"
        }
    }
}
